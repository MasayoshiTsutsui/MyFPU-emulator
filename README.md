# FPU simulator

In the CPU experiment, a class of Computer Science course in the University of Tokyo, we implemented a CPU and compiler to execute a given ray-tracing program.

We worked as 4 members.

I was responsible for inplementing FPU in hardware language.

This simulator imitates my FPU's behavior and was used to debug FPU hardware.
